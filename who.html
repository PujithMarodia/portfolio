<p>Hello! I'm Pujith, a twenty-two-year-old UX professional from Chennai, India. I'm currently in the final year of my degree BDes (Interaction Design) at the <a class="link"href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/faculties/arts-humanities-and-social-sciences/art" target="_blank">The Belfast School of Art</a> trying to solve India's litter crisis with <a class="link" href="https://www.notion.so/0802c868c320451f89ee21c1b9a594d5?v=2bd98c561288414a810b950f14e1e1c0" target="_blank">Saaf</a> . In the meanwhile I am also working as a UX designer at <a class="link" href="https://www.fathom.pro/" target="_blank">Fathom</a>.</p>
     
<p>I'm a multifaceted designer but I am most passionate about experience and interface design.</p>

<p>Not only do I have an obsession for detail and perfectly executed designs but I am also a huge advocate for user research. Usability, accessibility and inclusivity is the name of the game and I am always looking to create intriguing and concept enhancing interactions that remain intuitive for the user.</p>
    
<p>My goal is to perfect the end-user experience and help make the interface simplified, safe and beautiful by following a humanistic and empathetic approach to solving real user problems. I hope to do so by focusing on the complete environment of the digital.</p>
